# Landslide Detection System

Welcome to the Landslide Detection System repository!

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a cost-effective landslide detection system. Initially, we focus on integrating various sensors using Arduino or Raspberry Pi boards. These sensors include:
- Moisture sensor
- 3D accelerometer
- Rain gauge
- Temperature sensor
- Humidity sensor
- Tilt sensor

We provide the code for interfacing and collecting data from each of these sensors.

## Sensor Codes
- `moisture_sensor_code.ino`
- `accelerometer_code.ino`
- `rain_gauge_code.ino`
- `temperature_sensor_code.ino`
- `humidity_sensor_code.ino`
- `tilt_sensor_code.ino`

Feel free to explore and utilize these codes for your own projects!

## Second Stage
The second stage of our project involves data analysis using machine learning modules. Stay tuned for updates as we progress with this exciting phase.
